## Description
This is a javascript that automates generation of a professional README file. The user can specify project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, licencing, and contact info for GitHub and Email. This particular README file is also generated using this neat little app. This app needs inquirer installed to run successfully.
## Installation Instructions
```
npm init -y
npm i inquirer
```
## Usage Information
The user will run the index.js using node.js, and then the user will be asked questions in the terminal. Upon finishing the questions, a README file will be generated under the name outputREADME.md in the same directory. The file will include all aforementioned sections, as well as a table of contents at the top for easy access to the sections. A badge for the licence will be displaced near the top. The GubHub username will be formatted as a clickable link.
